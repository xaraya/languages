What is it? 

The Newsletter module allows an individual or organization to compile and distribute news and research updates to interested parties via email. This module gives writers, editors and publishers a comprehensive process to easily assemble the stories for an program area and subsequently publish the information to a subscription base. 

This module was originally created for the Charles and Helen Schwab Foundation  to distribute weekly updates on the program and research areas relevant to the foundation's learning differences and human services programs and initiatives.

Note: This overview is focused on the administrative tasks that must be performed before a publication can be created. For an overview of Newsletter, please refer to the overview in the main menu. 

As the module administrator, you will need to complete the following steps before you can start using the Newsletter module: 

1. Configure Roles and Privileges 

As the module administrator, you must configure the necessary roles and privileges for the Newsletter publishers, editors and writers. You can create the groups and privileges manually or can you use the adminstration modify configuration menu to easily create the default groups and privileges. After these groups and privileges have been created, you can then add a user to the publisher, editor or writer group. 

To add the groups and privileges, select Modify Configuration from the Newsletter administration menu. By default, the groups are assigned to the Everybody role. You can select the default groups and privileges to be created or you can set which role to assign these groups and change the default privilege for each group. 

The default groups and privileges are: 

Newsletter Publisher (AdminNewsletter privilege) 
    Can create, edit and delete stories, issues, publications and subscriptions.
    Can preview and publish issues. 
    Can set configuration for the information block.

    Can preview an issue.
    Cannot publish issues.

Once the groups and privileges are created, you do not need to modify the admin configuration unless you want to change the privilege of a group. 

2. Add an Newsletter user 

After the Newsletter groups and privileges have been successfully created, you can add users to these groups. Select "Add Newsletter User" from the Newsletter administration menu to add a user. Once a user has been added to the appropriate group, that user will have writer, editor or publisher privileges and will be able to start creating content for a publication.

Each sub-category of "Newsletter" will be a publication category.

For example:

|_ Learning Differences             publication category 
| |_ LD Experts in the News             story category
