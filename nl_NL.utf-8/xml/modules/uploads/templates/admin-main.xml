<entry><string>What is it?</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Uploads is a Xaraya Utility Module.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>It is currently responsible for accomplishing these tasks:</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Allows for the importing of files into the Xaraya system either locally or externally.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Allows the managing of access to files via privileges.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>How to use it?</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>External Imports and Uploads</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Files that are uploaded or imported from external locations can be saved in the database (DB)
or stored in the filesystem (FS). Use the options (FS/DB) under each form to select the
storage location for your file.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>The import engine will try to make a best guess for the name of the file you are trying to import.
In the event that it cannot figure out what the file name is it will use the following methods:</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>&lt;strong&gt;HTTP and HTTPS&lt;/strong&gt;</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>In the event that the filename for an HTTP import can not be determined, the file will be
named based on the host name of the server the file was imported from. For example, importing
http://www.xaraya.com/ would return a file with the name of www_xaraya_com.html</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Due to the underlying nature of the FTP protocol, it is impossible to successfully access a file
on a system without providing a viable file name. In this case, no file name 'guessing' will be
attempted and the import will fail.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Local Imports Sandbox</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Files can be inserted into your local import sandbox and used immediately by users with sufficient access to
add files and attach them to hooked objects (articles, comments, etc). Files you place in your local import
sandbox can be seen in the 'Import Local Files' form immediately upon adding them.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Privileges</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Uploads has the following privilege levels:</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>A role needs the ViewUploads privilege to view a file that has been uploaded and approved by the admin/editor.
If the file has not been approved, but submitted, the Edit privilege is needed to access the file.
You can use the autoapprove option to automatically approve all files uploaded by a certain user.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Included Blocks</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>There are no included blocks.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Included Hooks</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>The Uploads module does provide a transform hook. You can activate the uploads hook for a module or itemtype by going to</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Modules - Configure Hooks - Uploads Module</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>From there check the radio buttons next to the modules and itemtypes where you wish to activate the uploads module hooks.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>If you combine the hook with the upload property, then you can add parameters to the dynamic property. Set the options with:</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>This option will allow for a single upload, with external, uploaded and stored files, but not trusted ones. The basedir to look for stored files is the user dir, and new files will be placed there as well.</string><translation></translation></entry>
