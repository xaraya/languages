<entry><string>What is it?</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>The webdavserver module exposes the webdav protocol for a Xaraya site.
A traditional webdav implementation does this by pointing at a certain
location on the webserver and serving up files from there over WebDAV.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>The Xaraya WebDAV implementation exposes a virtual filesystem based on
the content of the site and (optionally) a location on the server.
The modules, their itemtypes and the items therein are elements in this
virtual filesystem which can then be accessed over WebDAV.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>WebDAV runs as a webservice in Xaraya, like xmlrpc and soap, so it's entry
point is ws.php instead of index.php.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>How to use it?</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>After the usual install through the modules module the WebDAV server is operational
and doesn't need any configuration in Xaraya itself. However because we need a virtual
filesystem root, we need a mapping from the entrypoint (ws.php?type=webdav&amp;amp;path=/) to
a directory like name where the virtual filesystem starts. To create such a mapping it
is necessary at this time to create a ReWrite rule in your webserver.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>The easiest way (i think) to create such a rewrite rule is to place a .htaccess file in
the webroot where xaraya is installed with similar contents as shown below:</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>The specific contents of this file may differ in your situation, but there are a number
of elements in it which should be present. The actual rewrite rule is at line 5.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Some remarks on the above:</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Line 1 turns the ReWriteEngine on for Apache, this may not be
necessary if you have this already enabled.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>I needed line 2 because some things in my webroot are symbolic links to
somewhere else, Line 2 makes sure they are followed through</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>The rewriterule on line 4 says i forbid access to the .htaccess file itself</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>The key line in the .htaccess file is line 5. You'll notice the word 'webdav' in there
and the entrypoint for the webdavserver. What this line does is if a request comes in at host.com/content/ over webdav
Xaraya actually executes host.com/ws.php?type=webdav&amp;amp;path=/content/</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>After this the /content/ is the root of the virtual filesystem Xaraya will create and:</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>will be the location to point your WebDAV to.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Limitations</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Requires PHP version 4.3 later than August 2003</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Apache with mod_rewrite is needed</string><translation></translation></entry>
