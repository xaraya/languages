		<string>This particular page is an example of content written in
an &lt;em&gt;override&lt;/em&gt; template and located in (#(1)/themename/modules/base/user-main.xt).
The template overrides the original that is located in the &lt;em&gt;base&lt;/em&gt; module.
This means its content is determined by the active theme in a Xaraya installation and not by the &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; template
which is part of the standard code and templates of Xaraya. This template also contains some simple blocklayout as an example.</string>

		<string>Of course, this is a tiny peek into Xaraya's templates and just the tip
of the iceberg. When you decide to use Xaraya, you'll get to know the templating
system in far more detail, but a good start is to have a look at the contents of
the file mentioned above.</string>
