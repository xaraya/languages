<entry><string>Development of the Xaraya Application Framework and this Xaraya web site takes time and effort, and decision making, and some fun thrown in. We would
like you all, as a decision maker, module or theme developer, web administrator or user of Xaraya to help us make some of these decisions. You can help
by voting in the following polls. We also hope the polls will make for some useful and lively discussion and debate in the related forum!</string><translation></translation></entry>
