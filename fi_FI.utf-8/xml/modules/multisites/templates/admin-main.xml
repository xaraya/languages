<entry><string>What is it?</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>The current Multisites Module assists with the creation of Xaraya
multisites. A Site Administrator can create and run multiple Xaraya sites from a single
installation of the Xaraya code base. There is currently a review of multisite logic
in Xaraya code in order to provide the functionality we ultimately are aiming for.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>At this time, the Multisites Module creates the
scripts and directories required to run your multisites.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>How to use it?</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>To use Xaraya multisites, you must have all domain and
subdomains that you wish to use for your 'subsites' resolving to the same
IP as your master Xaraya site domain name, or pointed to the same directory
as your main Xaraya install.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Assuming you already have installed Xaraya, we'll call this the 'master' site,
you must then run the Xaraya Installer for each additional site you wish to install. This will
create the database tables for each of your new sites. Make sure you protect the master
config.system.php file found in the /var directory so that it is not overwritten by each
additional subsite install process. Copy it out, and then put it back when
you have finished the install for the subsite(s).</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>From the menu, you have four choices:</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Add Site - Once you have set up the Master Multisite
Configuration</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>View Sites - This option lists the Master site and all
subsites. At this time, that is all it does :-)&lt;br/&gt;</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Admin Config - The admin configuration sets the
number of sites listed per page in the View Sites option.&lt;br/&gt;</string><translation></translation></entry>
