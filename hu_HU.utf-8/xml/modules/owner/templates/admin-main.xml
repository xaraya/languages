<entry><string>What is it?</string><translation>Mi ez?</translation></entry>
<entry><string>The Owner module is a simple utility module, which has no
direct user interface. The module operates entirely
through the hooks system.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>The functionality it provides is enabled by hooking the
owner module into another module. By doing so, the hooks
from this module will run when you create, update or
display an item in those modules. (the modify and delete
hooks are TODO )</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>On the create operation the owner module registers the user id
from the account which creates an item and logs the
module and item identification of that operation in the
database. This information is also created when updating
an item which does not have an owner yet.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>This means that for each item created in the hooked
modules there is a linkage between the user account
performing the operation and the module item to which it
applied. This linkage &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be interpreted as
ownership, but how the information is actually used is up
to the creator of other modules.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>The maintenance of the linkage, after you hook the owner
module into another module is automatically performed by
the module in cooperation with the hooks system.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>The owner module API furthermore exposes a 'get' and a
'getall' method to retrieve the &lt;em&gt;ownership&lt;/em&gt;
information on a certain item of a specific itemtype in a
particular module used in your application, which you can
retrieve for further processing.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>That's it, plain and simple.</string><translation></translation></entry>
<entry><string>Ideas for further work</string><translation></translation></entry>
