		<string>Using this administration system is very simple. First, you may want to configure the adminmenu appearance and the sorting order of the items in it.
            Of course, it largely depends on what kind of website you are running and on the number of admin-capable modules you deploy.
            Experiment with the options provided, and hopefully you will find the best solution for your administrative environment.
            For instance, position the menu left or right, choose a convenient display order and/or temporarily hide modules which you are not going to re-configure frequently.</string>

		<string>Secondly, you may configure this overview panel to show some more useful information than this text.
            Some options are (will be) available from &quot;Configure Overview&quot; panel.</string>
